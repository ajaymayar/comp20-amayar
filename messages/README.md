Uses an XML Http request to display messages from JSON data
Part 2: Opening index.html from my local machine did not work.  There was nothing to send a request to because there is no server.
Part 3: Opening from a URI did not work.   

It is not possible to request the data from an origin other than the server because  of the Same-origin policy.  The protocol, port, and host must be the same for the JSON data and the javaScript file requesting the data.  The Same-origin policy is used for security purposes, preventing malicious scripts from affecting or taking the data.

Uses an XML Http request to display messages from JSON data

Time spent: 15 mins

Is it possible to request the data from a different origin or from your local machine using XMLHttpRequest?  Why or why not?
	It is not possible because of the Same-origin policy.  The protocol, port, and host must be the same for the JSON data and the javaScript file requesting the data.  The Same-origin policy is used for security purposes, preventing malicious scripts from affecting or taking the data.
